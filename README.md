### Naming conventions
We're trying to mostly follow the sane GTK+ **naming** conventions in here, so basically:
- All macros and constants in caps: `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`, `TRACKING_ID_PREFIX`.
- Struct names, enums and typedef's in camelcase: `ArrayList`, `TrackingOrder`.
- Functions that operate on structs: classic C style: `array_list_init()`, `print_something()` (note the prefix for struct-related functions).
- Local variables/function parameters: `snake_case` please please please please please please

## Notes
- This project is just a Proof of Concept
